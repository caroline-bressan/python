Using Python for Research Homework: Week 5, Case Study Part 1
The movie dataset on which this case study is based is a database of 5000 movies catalogued by The Movie Database (TMDb). The information available about each movie is its budget, revenue, rating, actors and actresses, etc. In this case study, we will use this dataset to determine whether any information about a movie can predict the total revenue of a movie. We will also attempt to predict whether a movie's revenue will exceed its budget.

In Part 1, we will inspect, clean, and transform the data.

Exercise 1
First, we will import several libraries. scikit-learn (sklearn) contains helpful statistical models, and we'll use the matplotlib.pyplot library for visualizations. Of course, we will use numpy and pandas for data manipulation throughout.

Instructions
Read and execute the given code.
Call df.head() to take a look at the data.
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_predict
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv("https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:HarvardX+PH526x+2T2019+type@asset+block@movie_data.csv", index_col=0)

Exercise 2
In this exercise, we will define the regression and classification outcomes. Specifically, we will use the revenue column as the target for regression. For classification, we will construct an indicator of profitability for each movie.

Instructions
Create a new column in df called profitable, defined as 1 if the movie revenue is greater than the movie budget, and 0 otherwise.
Next, define and store the outcomes we will use for regression and classification.
Define regression_target as the string 'revenue'.
Define classification_target as the string 'profitable'.
df['profitable'] = np.where(df['revenue'] > df['budget'], 1, 0)
regression_target = 'revenue'
classification_target = 'profitable'
df[df['profitable']==1]
print(df['profitable'].value_counts()[1])
2585
Exercise 3
For simplicity, we will proceed by analyzing only the rows without any missing data. In this exercise, we will remove rows with any infinite or missing values.

Instructions
Use df.replace() to replace any cells with type np.inf or -np.inf with np.nan.
Drop all rows with any np.nan values in that row using df.dropna(). Do any further arguments need to be specified in this function to remove rows with any such values?
df.replace([np.inf,-np.inf],np.nan)
df.dropna()

Exercise 4
Many of the variables in our dataframe contain the names of genre, actors/actresses, and keywords. Let's add indicator columns for each genre.

Instructions
Determine all the genres in the genre column. Make sure to use the strip() function on each genre to remove trailing characters.
Next, include each listed genre as a new column in the dataframe. Each element of these genre columns should be 1 if the movie belongs to that particular genre, and 0 otherwise. Keep in mind, a movie may belong to several genres at once.
Call df[genres].head() to view your results.
df = df.dropna(how="any")
list_genres = df.genres.apply(lambda x: x.split(","))
genres = []
for row in list_genres:
    row = [genre.strip() for genre in row]
    for genre in row:
        if genre not in genres:
            genres.append(genre)
            
print(genres)
['Action', 'Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller', 'Animation', 'Family', 'Western', 'Comedy', 'Romance', 'Horror', 'Mystery', 'War', 'History', 'Music', 'Documentary', 'TV Movie', 'Foreign']
Exercise 5
Some variables in the dataset are already numeric and perhaps useful for regression and classification. In this exercise, we will store the names of these variables for future use. We will also take a look at some of the continuous variables and outcomes by plotting each pair in a scatter plot. Finally, we will evaluate the skew of each variable.

Instructions
Call plt.show() to observe the plot below.
Which of the covariates and/or outcomes are correlated with each other?
Call skew() on the columns outcomes_and_continuous_covariates in df.
Is the skew above 1 for any of these variables?
continuous_covariates = ['budget', 'popularity', 'runtime', 'vote_count', 'vote_average']
outcomes_and_continuous_covariates = continuous_covariates + [regression_target, classification_target]
plotting_variables = ['budget', 'popularity', regression_target]

axes = pd.plotting.scatter_matrix(df[plotting_variables], alpha=0.15, \
       color=(0,0,0), hist_kwds={"color":(0,0,0)}, facecolor=(1,0,0))
plt.show()

print(df[outcomes_and_continuous_covariates].skew())

budget          1.754872
popularity      7.968139
runtime         1.059804
vote_count      2.461041
vote_average   -1.080038
revenue         3.084680
profitable     -1.081030
dtype: float64
Exercise 6
It appears that the variables budget, popularity, runtime, vote_count, and revenue are all right-skewed. In this exercise, we will transform these variables to eliminate this skewness. Specifically, we will use the np.log10() method. Because some of these variable values are exactly 0, we will add a small positive value to each to ensure it is defined; this is necessary because log(0) is negative infinity.

Instructions
For each above-mentioned variable in df, transform value x into np.log10(1+x).
 
for covariate in ['budget', 'popularity', 'runtime', 'vote_count', 'revenue']:
    df[covariate] = df[covariate].apply(lambda x: np.log10(1+x))
    
    print(df[outcomes_and_continuous_covariates].skew())
budget         -3.281368
popularity     -1.664304
runtime         0.000000
vote_count     -2.682826
vote_average   -1.080038
revenue        -2.559249
profitable     -1.081030
dtype: float64

Exercise 7
Let's now save our dataset.

Instructions
Use to_csv() to save the df object as movies_clean.csv.
df.to_csv('movies_clean')
